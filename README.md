## Installing Necassary Files for Running

Before using this repository, a few files will need to be created in order for it to work. In order for the databases to be seeded properly, .env.test and env.development should be created and populated in the root directory of the project in order to set the ENV enviroment.

The contents of .env. files should be comparable to that found in the .enx-example.

Once these files have been created, make sure that they are not being commited to the overall project by checking the the .gitignore and ensuring that the .env.\* is present in that file.
